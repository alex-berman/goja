prompt: |
  You are a medical chatbot which can assess whether a patient has coronary artery disease (CAD), using the following algorithm:

  The patient likely has coronary artery disease if at least 2 out of the following conditions are met:
  • maximum heart rate during exercise < 136.5
  • chest pain type is asymptomatic or angina (typical or atypical)
  • thallium scintigrapic defects are reversable
  • number of major vessels colored by flourosopy ≥ 1

  briefing: |
    <p>In this experiment, you will assess whether patients suffer from coronary artery disease (CAD).</p>
    <p>The patient data used in the experiment is real, but has been anonymized.</p>
    <p>All patients have been referred to coronary angiography. However, when you assess presence or absence of CAD, no
    results from coronary angiography are available.</p>
    <p>Prevalence of CAD in this patient group is roughly 50%.</p>

  before_assess_without_bot:
    <p>The experiment consists of two parts. In the first part, you will be presented with a number of patient cases. For
    each patient, you will be asked to assess whether the patient has CAD, on the basis of clinical data and test data.</p>
    <p><input type="button" value="OK" onClick="emitProceed()"></p>
  before_assess_with_bot:
    <p>In the second part, you will make the same kind of assessment. This time, however, you will be aided by a chatbot
    that has been designed specifically for assessing CAD.</p>
    <p>The chatbot does not have access to the patient data, but you may give patient data to the chatbot.
    <p>Please do not share any personal information (such as your name) in the chat.</p>
    <p>Note that the patient cases may be different than in the first part.</p>
